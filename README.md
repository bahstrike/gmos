# GMOS v1.5      2006 Strike



## About
GMOS (Garry's Mod Operating System) is a
collection of scripts that make up a fake OS.





## Installation
All GMOS scripts should be in:
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\gmod9\lua\strike

2)  Open console and type:
    lua_openscript strike/main.lua

## Using GMOS
All of GMOS' commands are typed in chat (not console). Most GMOS commands
require you to be aiming at an object or a spot on the ground.

The GENERAL COMMANDS do not require you to be aiming at anything in particular.

# Known Bugs
Destroying breakable objects (such as wood or explosive barrels) can cause object IDs
to be reused without GMOS unregistering the original object. The result means that
sometimes an object may become locked when nobody locked it. Usually the host is able to
unlock the object  (gmos tweak unlock).
